# Canvas Booster

> [!NOTE]
> This project is very much a work in progress and probably not ready for you to download and use. Eventually it'll be a Chrome extension that you'll be able to install through the Chrome Web Store. For now it's just a lonely GitHub repo.

Canvas Booster is a Chrome extension that adds to the Canvas LMS features that I wish were there. For now there are only two.

**Days late in gradebook**

Instead of having to click on another dialog or go into Speed Grader you'll be able to see the number of days late on assignments directly in the gradebook. 

**Import QTI into existing quizzes**

This is the big one. Once you load a quiz into Canvas from a QTI file there's no way to add more questions from another QTI file. This extension will let you do that.
